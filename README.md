URL title fetching bot for IRC in Rust. The bot monitors all messages sent to
it in any IRC channels it's joined to, if any messages contain URLs, the bot
fetches the page and extracts the title, posting the result on the same
channel, adding a certain je ne sais quoi to your IRC experience.

For example:

    <user> http://rust-lang.org/
    <url-bot-rs> â¤· The Rust Programming Language

## Build

### Get Rust

[https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)

e.g. on a Unix-like OS:

    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

### Build

    git clone https://github.com/nuxeh/url-bot-rs
    cd url-bot-rs
    cargo build

### Run tests

    cargo test

## Configuration file

A configuration file is required to specify IRC server details and other
general settings for the bot, a path to this config can be specified manually
with the `--conf=<path>` command line option. If not provided, url bot will
look in a default path for your platform, e.g. on Linux it will use the XDG
specification:

    ~/.config/url-bot-rs/config.toml

or, if `$XDG_CONFIG_PATH` is set:

    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/url-bot-rs/config.toml

The `--conf` parameter may be provided multiple times, in order to connect to
multiple servers/networks.

Additionally, a search path may be specified with the `--conf-dir=<dir>` CLI
argument, with the effect that any valid configurations existing
non-recursively under this path will be loaded. This option may also be
specified multiple times.

### Configuration file options

The configuration includes settings pertaining to the IRC server the bot will
connect to, including among other things:

- Address of the IRC server
- Connection credentials
- The nick the bot will use when joining
- Channels to join

The `[network]` section gives some metadata for the network the configuration
will connect to, including:

- `name` (string) an identifier for the network.

It is also possible to configure a number of optional features for the bot's
operation, specified in the `[features]` section:

- `mask_highlights` (bool) inserts invisible characters to defeat highlight
  regexes
- `send_notice` (bool) causes the bot to respond with notices rather than
  private messages
- `report_metadata` (bool) if enabled, causes image metadata to be reported
- `report_mime` (bool) if enabled, causes mime types to be reported, if no
  other title or metadata is found.
- `history` (bool) enable previous post information using a database
- `invite` (bool) if enabled, `/invite` will cause the bot to join a channel.
- `autosave` (bool) if enabled, `/invite` and `/kick` will automatically write
  out the active configuration with an updated list of channels.
- `send_errors_to_poster` (bool) if enabled, sends any errors occurring when
  trying to resolve a link to the user posting the link, in a private message.
- `reply_with_errors` (bool) if enabled, always reply with error messages.
- `partial_urls` (bool) attempt to resolve titles for URLs without scheme, e.g.
  "docs.rs".
- `nick_response` (bool) respond with a message if bot is pinged in a message
  with no other action to perform.

The `[parameters]` section includes a number of tunable parameters:

- `url_limit` (u8) max number of URLs to process for each message (default: 10)
- `accept_lang` (string) language requested in http content requests
  (default: "en")
- `status_channels` (list) channel(s) to create, join and message with any
  error messages produced from URL title retrieval
- `nick_response_str` (string) the message to send for the nick response feature

The `[database]` section contains options for the database, as follows:

- `path` (string) is the path to a database file (for `sqlite`)
- `type` (string) is the type of database to use, e.g. `sqlite`

If no configuration file exists at the expected location, a default-valued
configuration file will be created. An example configuration is provided as
`example.config.toml` in this repository.

## Database

A database may be specified, which is used to cache posted links, so that if
the same URL is posted again, the original poster and the time posted is added
to the returned message. This feature can be enabled using the `history`
feature within the `[features]` section of the configuration file.

Currently supported database type strings are:

- `in-memory`
- `sqlite`

The database type may be specified in the `[database]` configuration section,
as field `type`. A corresponding path to use for the database may be given as
field, `path`.

For SQLite, if no path is specified, a default path will be used, and a
database will be created according to the network name specified in the
`[network]` section of the configuration.

## Install from source

### Cargo

    cargo install --git https://github.com/nuxeh/url-bot-rs

### Debian/Ubuntu (Linux)

    git clone https://github.com/nuxeh/url-bot-rs
    cd url-bot-rs
    cargo install cargo-deb
    cargo deb --install

### Nix

The following should be run on NixOS, or inside a Nix environment on another
OS.

    git clone https://github.com/nuxeh/url-bot-rs
    cd url-bot-rs
    nix-build
    nix-env -if default.nix

If the nix derivation needs to be updated after adding dependencies, etc, run
the following command, having installed
[crate2nix](https://github.com/kolloch/crate2nix):

    crate2nix generate -o derivation.nix -n "<nixpkgs>"

## Running as a service

The bot can be run automatically as a service by `systemd`. This is set up
automatically in the case of a Debian package install, or alternatively can be
set up manually.

### Debian package install

If you install using the Debian package, a `url-bot-rs` user is created
automatically. Additionally, the systemd unit is installed, and the service is
enabled and started automatically, after installation.

The configuration should be customised as described in "Customising
configuration" below.

When uninstalling the Debian package, the `url-bot-rs` user nor its home
directory files are deleted, according to Debian packaging guidelines. This
keeps UIDs more deterministic, and allows re-installation or upgrade without
losing the bot's configuration.

### Manual systemd install

To set up systemd manually, the unit file must be copied, and the `url-bot-rs`
user must be created on the system. From inside the project repository:

    sudo install -m 644 systemd/url-bot-rs.service /etc/systemd/system/
    sudo useradd -m --system url-bot-rs --shell /usr/sbin/nologin
    sudo systemctl enable --now url-bot-rs.service

The configuration should be customised as described in "Customising
configuration" below.

### Customising configuration

Once started once, a default configuration is created in
`/home/url-bot-rs/.config/url-bot-rs/config.toml`, which should be edited, and
the bot restarted:

    sudo systemctl restart url-bot-rs.service

### Checking status

To check status or get logs:

    systemctl status url-bot-rs.service
    sudo journalctl -u url-bot-rs.service

## `url-bot-rs` additional command line options

- Usage is printed by providing `--help` on run.
- To print additional runtime information, add `-v` or `--verbose`. The level
  of verbosity can be increased by adding extra `v`s; at higher levels of
  verbosity IRC messages received, HTTP response headers, and information
  regarding resolution of URLs, such as cookies set, can be printed.

## Additional CLI tools

The crate comes with additional binary tools, to aid in testing URL title
retrieval.

### `url-bot-get`

Performs title retrieval using the same code that is used in the bot, but
instead supplied with URLs via the command line, with tweakable request
parameters, such as user agent, and others. It is intended to be useful for
debugging cases where title retrieval fails for some reason, to assist in
offline development.

## IRC

There is an IRC channel on [Moznet](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC), `#url-bot-rs`.
